# URI-Parser-and-some-interesting-handlers
The URI parser resides in the directory /URI with some unit tests in /Google_tests.
There are 2 check-programs: SSH client checker and a encryption checker, both are included in /checkFiles.
The /Reverser includes a script that reverses the endianness of a 32-bit number in JS.

Note that no encryption pattern is assumed before checking a file, the program only determines if there is a great chance that the file is encrypted or not.
